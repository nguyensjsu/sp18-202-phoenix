## XP Core value - Courage

### Week 1
  * At first we began to design about how our game should be. Each one of us came up with game ideas and we had a meeting to discuss about that. We were willing to accept feedbacks from our teammates and to adapt our ideas based on that.
  * We had a meeting to update our progress and we honestly told the truth of our progress as we showed all the works we did during the week to teammates.
  * We did tell what we are now stuck at to our teammates. We listed the blocked task in the weekly scrum journal so that each team member can help figure out the solution.
  * Since this is the first phase of our game development, we implemented a lot of prototypes to prove our game concept. We are willing to write new codes or refactor our prototypes when it comes to implement our actual game.

### Week 2
  * We threw some code away and wrote a new one to make it cleaner and easier to use.
  * We continued to figure out about how to implement some features of the game. Again, we are willing to refactor it when necessary.
  * We shared all of our progress so far and also the blocking tasks in the meeting.

### Week 3
  * As we continue to work on the project, we found some functionality which is not easy to implement. We did tell other team members and were willing to ask for help to get the project done as soon as possible.
  * We cleared some codes or assets from the prototyping phase away and implemented new ones so that we can apply design patterns easier.

### Week 4
  * We changed some class design in order to make it more generic and easy to use further more in our project.
  * We updated all of our progress more frequently as we are on the final phase of development.
  * We removed some of our prototype assets to make our game cleaner.
