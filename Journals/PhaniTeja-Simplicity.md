## XP Core Value - Simplicity


### Week-1
We started off by meeting up and discussing various ideas for the hackathon project. We thought it'd be best if we could keep things simple,atleast until we've reached and got past the proof of concept stage. We worked through the first week to complete the said proof of concept with just one goal, "get the simplest of things, in every aspect working", and then build upon the working prototype. There were times during brainstorming and prototype development, when we had to dial it down a notch, as it was getting a tad bit complicated than we've previously wished for, and keeping ourselves from veering off the path we've started on. As a result we now have a solid base line to continue and complete the project efficiently.

### Week-2
We divided the tasks into simpler modules and each member selected a few modules and started to work on them. This further division of tasks gave us more insight as to which modules might be dependent, thereby reducing the possibility of being blocked by another task, no matter how small. As a result by the end of the week, we had a working level-1, with just few modifications pending.
