## XP Core value - Feedback

### Week 1
We thought that it will be useful to get early feedback on our video game idea from the professor. We worked hard during the first week to make a presentable prototype before the end of class on 07Apr2018. During office hours, we presented our prototype to our professor to ensure that we are on the right track for our video game. Our Professor thought that our video game idea and the prototype is really good. This feedback tells us that we are on the right track with the progress we have made so far and gives us confidence to move forward with our original ideas for our game development.

### Week 2
We had to decide which assets we were going to use to for our video game sprites. We provided different choices and listened closely to everyones suggestions and provided feedback. Thanks to this we came to a decision to use sprites from the Mario universe. We also thought it will be a great idea have Bowser Jr. be the good guy and Mario be the bad guy.
