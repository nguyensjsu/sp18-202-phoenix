## XP Core value - Feedback

### Week 1
We thought that it will be useful to get early feedback on our video game idea from the professor. We worked hard during the first week to make a presentable prototype before the end of class on 07Apr2018. During office hours, we presented our prototype to our professor to ensure that we are on the right track for our video game. Our Professor thought that our video game idea and the prototype is really good. This feedback tells us that we are on the right track with the progress we have made so far and gives us confidence to move forward with our original ideas for our game development.
