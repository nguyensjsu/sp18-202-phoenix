## XP Core value - Courage

### Week 1
  * At first we began to design about how our game should be. Each one of us came up with game ideas and we had a meeting to discuss about that. We were willing to accept feedbacks from our teammates and to adapt our ideas based on that.
  * We had a meeting to update our progress and we honestly told the truth of our progress as we showed all the works we did during the week to teammates.
  * We did tell what we are now stuck at to our teammates. We listed the blocked task in the weekly scrum journal so that each team member can help figure out the solution.
  * Since this is the first phase of our game development, we implemented a lot of prototypes to prove our game concept. We are willing to write new codes or refactor our prototypes when it comes to implement our actual game.
