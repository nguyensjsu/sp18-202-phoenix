## XP Core value - Communication

### Week 1
* After meeting with the team we decided to use messenger tool - whatsApp for all team communication. Which is eesential part of keeping everyone in sync and having better compatibility when developing code in collaboration.
* We also decided to meet twice a week, on Tuesday and Saturday after class so that we are all in touch and catch up on any issues.  
* During the team meeting we also discussed:
	<ol>
       <li>what XP core values we would each be following.</li>
       <li>Type of game we all were interested in developing for this project.</li>
       <li>Next task of get upto speed with Unity engine.</li>
       <li>What task each of us needs to do in order to complete level 1 with simple features.</li>
	
### Week 2
* We discussed about difficulties faced during past week while researching and trying to implement certain features in Unity game engine.
* Team has decided on completing level 1 by this week.
* Erb has decided to work and implement the item usage.
* I will be working on Enemy movement and interaction.
* Phani is working with Item events
* we have decided that each team member will be responsible in developing one level of the game and will implement design pattern based on the logic for that level. 

### Week 3
* This week the communication via WhatsApp and Scrum task sheet was plenty sufficient. Everyone was able to decide on the issues and the task people want to work on. 
* Team members are also starting to look for places where any Design pattern could also be implemented. This will also mean more ingeration and sync will be needed.
* Maintaining good communicaiton lines will be essential for smooth and efficient work. I will have to play more effective role and keep track that the team members are effectively speaking to each other.

### Week 4
* This week also the communication via WhatsApp and Scrum task sheet had a few tasks left. Everyone was able to decide on the issues and the task people want to work on. 
* Since we are on the final stage of our project many tasks are linked/dependent on other tasks which makes proper communication very important.
* Team members are also discussing and planning which design pattern each of us will implement and will use the best design pattern to present it during our class presentation.
* Maintaining good communicaiton lines will be essential for smooth and efficient work. I will have to play more effective role and keep track that the team members are effectively speaking to each other.

### Week 5
* Since we are close to the deadline for the team hackathon project. we decided to meet everyday for few hours to increase communication and co-ordinate our efforts well to complete the task within alloted time.
* I was able to co-ordinate and manage the task with other members as each one of us was finding it difficult to meet at a perticular time due to other projects from other courses.
* we were finally able to complete the game and all the bugs and minor issues were discussed with the group so we can fix and help each other out.
* I was also responsible to go through the whole submission list from the assignment page on canvas to make sure each of us were working on point and fulfilling all the requirements set forth by the professor.
