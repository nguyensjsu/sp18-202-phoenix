## XP Core value - Communication

### Week 1
* After meeting with the team we decided to use messenger tool - whatsApp for all team communication. Which is eesential part of keeping everyone in sync and having better compatibility when developing code in collaboration.
* We also decided to meet twice a week, on Tuesday and Saturday after class so that we are all in touch and catch up on any issues.  
* During the team meeting we also discussed:
	<ol>
       <li>what XP core values we would each be following.</li>
       <li>Type of game we all were interested in developing for this project.</li>
       <li>Next task of get upto speed with Unity engine.</li>
       <li>What task each of us needs to do in order to complete level 1 with simple features.</li>
	
### Week 2
* We discussed about difficulties faced during past week while researching and trying to implement certain features in Unity game engine.
* Team has decided on completing level 1 by this week.
* Erb has decided to work and implement the item usage.
* I will be working on Enemy movement and interaction.
* Phani is working with Item events
* we have decided that each team member will be responsible in developing one level of the game and will implement design pattern based on the logic for that level. 

### Week 3
* This week the communication via WhatsApp and Scrum task sheet was plenty sufficient. Everyone was able to decide on the issues and the task people want to work on. 
* Team members are also starting to look for places where any Design pattern could also be implemented. This will also mean more ingeration and sync will be needed.
* Maintaining good communicaiton lines will be essential for smooth and efficient work. I will have to play more effective role and keep track that the team members are effectively speaking to each other.
