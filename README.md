# Super Bowser Jr. World

Team hackathon repository for Spring 2018 CMPE 202 course in SJSU with professor Paul Nguyen. 

We created a simple 2D game using the Unity game engine. The protagonist of the game is Bowser Jr. He embarks upon a journey to avenge his fallen friend Yoshi. In our game you will play as Bowser Jr. where you will battle your way through Mario and Luigiâ€™s minions, to teach the ones who wronged his friend a lesson or two.

The repo has the following strucure:

* **Journals** - Our Weekly Scrum meeting and XP core value journal entries

* **Prototypes** - Early prototypes and experimentation

* **artifacts** - Contains Original game UI concept

* **assets** - Some game assets

* **game** - Unity project with all of the scripts, animations, levels, etc.
